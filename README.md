This is the backend solution for the Coffee Shop app. It is built using ASP.NET Web API and follows a microservices architecture. The project includes multiple Web API services, including Auth, Catalog, Ordering, ShoppingCart, and API Gateway services.

This infrastructure setup uses Bicep to deploy various resources and services for the Coffee Shop app on Azure. 

1. Azure Container Apps: Deploys microservices such as Auth, Catalog, Ordering, ShoppingCart, and API Gateway. These services are containerized using Docker for easy deployment and scalability.
2. MSSQL, Entity Framework: Hosts the main relational database (coffeeshop-sqldb) for storing catalog, user and order data.
3. PostgreSQL: Manages the shopping cart data (shoppingcart-db-postgresql).
4. Azure Service Bus: Handles message queuing and communication between microservices (e.g., for order processing).
5. Azure Functions: Manages checkout processing via the process-checkout function, which is triggered by messages from the Azure Service Bus. This function receives checkout data, processes it, and sends it to the Ordering API to create an order.
6. TLS/SSL Certificate: Ensures secure connections with the coffeeshop-cert

External Dependencies and Links:

1. The API Gateway links all microservices together, routing requests from the frontend to the appropriate services. It also adds a JWT token to requests to ensure secure communication and authentication between services.
2. The Authentication API is used for securing user access, with JWT tokens being validated across services.

The project utilizes Docker to containerize all backend services, Docker Compose is used for local development
